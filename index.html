<p>THE BIRTH OF FREITAG</p>

With a sewing machine in the kitchen and a laundry in the bathtub: Oliver Gemperle, a former roommate of Daniel and Markus Freitag, tells us how the FREITAG story began back in the early 90s.
LET'S GO BACK TO 1993
My room in the apartment cost me all of 300 bucks.<p style="margin-top:10px;"></p> No wonder. The flat was a dump, the plaster was peeling off the walls in pieces as big as plates, and wheezing away in the bathroom was a gas-powered flow water heater. Directly in front of the house, trucks thundered noisily across the bridge that cut the city in two.
